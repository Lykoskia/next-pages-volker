# My First Next.js app

## Overview

A modern showcase and a testament to contemporary web practices, this Next.js project is the evolution of a static site into a performant, statically generated application. Hosted with Vercel for superior delivery.

## Technical Features

- **Next.js SSG**: Utilizes `getStaticProps` and `getStaticPaths` for enhanced performance and SEO.
- **Tailwind CSS**: Employs Tailwind for responsive styling and conditional rendering of a sticky footer on desktop.
- **Interactive UI**: Images that scale on hover, carousels for visual storytelling, and expandable 'Read more' sections.
- **Performance**: Lazy loading and deferred loading of off-screen images for a seamless user experience.
- **I18n**: Supports multiple languages with dynamic routing and imports, providing a global UX.

## Development Insights

## History

I originally built this website in late 2022 by directly writing HTML/CSS files, and all of my JavaScript was basically a few jQuery scripts.
Unsatisfied with full page reloads, unoptimized images, and eager to apply everything I've learned about React (and Next) since then, I set out to modernize this website in late 2023.
Currently waiting for new card images from the client, and possibly content updates, but as far as features go, everything is implemented and working as intended.
